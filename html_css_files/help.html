           The Goal of Blackjack is get the closest to 21 without going over. Each number card has the value shown. 
           For example the 3 of hearts has a value of 3. Each face card has a value of 10. The Face cards are: JACK, QUEEN, 
           KING. The Ace card can take on the values 1 or 11 depending on the hand. Each player is dealt 2 cards at the beginning. 
           Your total will be displayed displayed. When it is your turn will have the option to hit or to stay. Hit means 
           to take a new card from the deck and the value of the card will be add to your total. If your total is 
           above 21, you have "bust" and lost that round. If you are happy with your intial draw or after you have drawn 
           enough cards to get the closest you can to 21, you can hit the stay option. This option will move to the next player's 
           turn. Once all the players have played. It is the dealers turn. If the dealer has less then 17 then the dealer is required
           to continue to pull cards until he reaches 17 or higher. If the dealer busts then every player wins. If the dealer does not 
           bust, then each players hand is checked. If the player has a higher total than the dealer, then the player wins otherwise
           the player looses. If the player's total and the dealer's total match then it is a tie. If the player wins then the dealer 
           will match their bet. If the player looses then the player will give their bet to the dealer. If the player ties with the 
           dealer then the player gets to keep their bet. After each game, the player stats will be updated.
